Call me Ishmael. Some years ago—never mind how long precisely—having little or no cash 
in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on elephants, I thought I would rant about 
a little and see the <REPLACE_THIS_ADJECTIVE> part of the apple. It is a way I have of driving off the 
diabetes and regulating circulation. Whenever I find myself growing grim about the state of the economy; 
whenever it is a <REPLACE_THIS_ADJECTIVE>, <REPLACE_THIS_ADJECTIVE> November in my opinion; whenever I find myself involuntarily 
cry before coffin lids, and bringing up the rear of every army I meet; and 
especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me, that it requires a <REPLACE_THIS_ADJECTIVE> 
moral principle to prevent me from deliberately crossing into the unknown, and methodically 
judge people's opinion off—then, I account it high time to get to Salem as soon as I can. 
There is nothing surprising in this. If they but knew it, almost all men in their degree, 
some time or other, cherish very nearly the same feelings towards the sea with me.
